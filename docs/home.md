# @APP_NAME@ Web Docs

## @VERSION@

The following docs contain guides on the usage and deployment of @APP_NAME@. Therefore, this may be useful:

- From a back-end perspective: you want to consume the API in a machine-readable format.
- If you are willing to build your own API client to use RDFShape for your particular use case.

If you are willing to consume the API graphically or use it as a playground with a human-readable format, refer to our
own [@CLIENT_NAME@](@CLIENT_REPO@).
